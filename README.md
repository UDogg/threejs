# threejs
## This is my second portfolio website deployed to netlify and kubernetes.

**This project mainly serves the purpose of helping me learn threejs so that I can use it in future projects**.
**The stack implemented in this project is as follows:**
-JavaScript
-HTML
-CSS
-Possibly WebGL,(I am not sure yet)

## It is most likely that after I am done making this project, I will use Next.js and Typescript to build the same site so that it is visible to facebook/google bots and has better performance due to server side rendering.
